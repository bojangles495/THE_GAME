{name}s family has two equal size {food1}s. Each {food1} was cut into {num1} equal pieces. The family ate one whole {food1} and {numless1} pieces of the other {food1}. What Mixed Fraction shows how much {food1} was eaten?;{num3} 1/{num1};1 {numless1}/{num1};{num2} {numless1}/{num1};1 {numless1}/{num1};Tip: Think about how many whole pieces of {food1} were eaten.This is your whole number.Now think about what fraction represents 1 piece of one {food1}.This can help you create your fraction
{name} has {orderedFraction3} of a {food1}.and gives {orderedFraction1} of it away to {name2}.and {orderedFraction1} of it away to the teacher.How much {food1} does {name} have left?;{otherFraction};{fraction1};1/1{num1};{otherFraction};Tip:First find the least common denominator.Then write the equivalent fractions.Now think about the total {name} was giving away.How much less is this than what {name} started with?
{name} and {name2} are at a picnic.{food1}s are {orderedFraction2} of the food.{food2}s are {orderedFraction1} of the food.{food3}s are {orderedFraction3} of the food.Order the foods from least to most;{food2}s, {food1}s, {food3}s;{food1}s, {food2}s, {food3}s;{food3}s, {food2}s, {food1}s;{food2}s, {food1}s, {food3}s;Tip: Use the least common multiple of the denominators to find the least common denominator.Write the equivalent fractions with the least common denominator.Then compare the fractions!
