#For the Tic-Tac_Toe game to run the FONT_PATH variable at the top of the Tic-Tac-Toe.py file in the /game directory must point to a valid .ttf file. 

#I included the FreeMono.ttf file I used when testing the game in the /game directory so changing the FONT_PATH variable to point to it should do the trick.
