{name}s family has two equal size {food1}s. Each {food1} was cut into {num1} equal pieces. The family ate one whole {food1} and {numless1} pieces of the other {food1}. What Mixed Fraction shows how much {food1} was eaten?;1 1/{num1};1 {numless1}/{num1};{num2} {numless1}/{num1};1 {numless1}/{num1};Tip: Think about how many whole pieces of {food1} were eaten.This is your whole number.Now think about what fraction represents 1 piece of one {food1}.This can help you create your fraction
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} + {fraction2} = ;{fractionAdd2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionAdd2};Tip
The answer is written in simplest form: {orderedFraction3} - {orderedFraction2} = ;{fractionSub2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionSub2};Tip
{name} has {fraction1} of a {food1}.and gives 1/{num1} of it away to {name2}.and 1/{num1} of it away to his teacher.How much {food1} does he have left?;{otherFraction};{fraction1};1/1{num1};{otherFraction};Tip:
