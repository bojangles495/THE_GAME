{name} cut a {food1} into {num1} pieces.{name} eats {numless1} pieces.What fraction in simplest form.shows the portion of the {food1} eaten?;{fraction1};{fraction2};{fraction3};{fraction1};Tip: Write the numerator (Think about how many pieces were used).Now write the denominator (Think about the total number of pieces).Now to simplify divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). 
{name} has {num1} {food1}s, {num2} {food2}s, and {num3} {food3}s. What fraction of {name}s foods are {food1}s?;{num1}/{total};{num1}/{nummore1};{fraction1};{num1}/{total};Tip: Think about {food1} as s fraction of the total food. 
At lunch {name} ate {num1} {orderedFraction1} of {food1}.and {name2} ate {num1} {orderedFraction2} of {food1}. Who ate more?;{name2};{name};Neither;{name2};Tip:
{name} and {name2} are at a picnic.{orderedFraction2} of the food is {food1}.{orderedFraction1} of the food is {food2}.{orderedFraction3} of the food is {food3}. Order the foods from least to most;{food2}, {food1}, {food3};{food1}, {food2}, {food3};{food3}, {food2}, {food1};{food2}, {food1}, {food3};Tip: Use the least common multiple of the denominators to find the least common denominator.Write the equivalent fractions with the least common demo nominator.Then compare the fractions!
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} X {fraction2} = ;{fractionMult2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionMult2};Tip
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} divided by {fractionEasy} = ;{fractionDiv};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionDiv};Tip
