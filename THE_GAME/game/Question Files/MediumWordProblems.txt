{name} cut a {food1} into {num1} pieces.{name} eats {numless1} pieces.What fraction in simplest form.shows the portion of the {food1} eaten?;{fraction1};{fraction2};{fraction3};{fraction1};Tip: Write the numerator (Think about how many pieces were used).Now write the denominator (Think about the total number of pieces).Now to simplify divide the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF). 
{name} has {num1} {food1}s, {num2} {food2}s, and {num3} {food3}s. What fraction of {name}s foods are {food1}s?;{num1}/{total};{num1}/{nummore1};{fraction1};{num1}/{total};Tip: Think about {food1} as s fraction of the total food. 
At lunch {name} ate {num1} {orderedFraction1} of {food1}.and {name2} ate {num1} {orderedFraction2} of {food1}. Who ate more?;{name2};{name};Neither;{name2};Tip:
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} X {fraction2} = ;{fractionMult2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionMult2};Tip
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} divided by {fractionEasy} = ;{fractionDiv};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionDiv};Tip
The answer is written in simplest form: {fraction1} + {fraction2} = ;{fractionAdd2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionAdd2};Tip
The answer is written in simplest form: {orderedFraction3} - {orderedFraction2} = ;{fractionSub2};{fraction3};{numless1}/{num2};{fractionSub2};Tip
